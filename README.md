# Qube

Qube is a virtual office that enables you to work remotely! It connects with Slack (a chat-based collaboration tool) and Zoom (a video and audio conferencing tool) to provide an effective virtual office experience. Qube provides office context - who's talking to who, who's out of the office and who just stepped out to lunch.
